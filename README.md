I made this project to show skills I got from **Jonas JS Courses**

> It is simple game where player have to guess a random number from 1 to 20 after every fail, player's score is decrcresed.

### 3. How to install?

1. Clone repo to your folder
2. You should open a site with live server by using extension called "LiveServer" or use a command in your console:
   > npm install -g live-server // if you have node. js instaled

Then write

> live-server

It should work! ğŸ˜‚

### 4. Let's play!
